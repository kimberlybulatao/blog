                    Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have no choice but to isolate ourselves in our homes to avoid being infected by the virus. The lockdown may continue longer than we want to and people are challenged to keep working despite the pandemic. Others continue to enjoy their time at home with their families and friends. As for me, I realized that this can also be a good opportunity to reflect on ourselves.
